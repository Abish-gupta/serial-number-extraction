# Serial Number Extraction (Demo Mode)

> **⚡ Demo Mode: Extraction is disabled. This UI shows the user experience, but no paid backend/API is active.**

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Team was noting down serial numbers manually into an Excel sheet for each image. For every truck (20-25 images) received in 5+ warehouses, this took 5–8 minutes per image and often led to human error.

## 💡 Solution
Web app for bulk uploading images and extracting serial numbers via AI/automation. The backend originally leveraged N8N, Google Drive, Gemini AI, and Google Sheets. The UI is modern, responsive, and user-friendly.

- Eliminates manual entry and errors
- Saves hours of work weekly

---

## ✨ Features
- Upload up to 30 serial number images at once
- Drag & drop or paste screenshot import
- Batch meta info and auto-ID generation
- 100% static: works entirely in the browser
- **Demo Mode:** Real serial extraction & backend API are disabled in this public release
